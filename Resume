        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p> My name is <strong>Aneta Sullivan</strong>, and I am a self-motivated, creative and analytical Pace University graduate <br>
        from the Czech Republic that is passionate about Media and Design Marketing. By traveling the world, I was able to gain <br>
        many experiences with unfamiliar situations that taught me how to <em>adapt quickly</em> and to <em>solve any problems</em> on the way. <br>
        I am always looking for new challenges that will help me to move forward to achieving my goals.
